# Ercot-load-forecast
This project builds a real-time electricity load forecasting system using live ERCOT grid data. A FastAPI backend retrieves and processes demand data, runs a forecasting model, and serves predictions to a Tableau dashboard that visualizes actual vs forecast load and forecast accuracy with on-demand refresh.
